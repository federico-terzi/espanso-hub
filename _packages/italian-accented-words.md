This package contains a list of accented Italian words substitutions.
It only contains words which don't have a non-accented corresponding word in the Italian dictionary.
For example 'scherzò' is not present since 'scherzo' is also a valid Italian word, while 'città' is present because 'citta' is not an Italian word.
